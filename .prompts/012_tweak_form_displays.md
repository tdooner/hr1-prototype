**User**

Let's make a few adjustments to various forms.

First, let's use "usa-legend--lange" on all the legend tags.

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you update all the legend tags to use the "usa-legend--large" class. Let me first search for all legend tags in the codebase to see what needs to be updated.


Now let me search for any other legend tags that might not have the usa-legend class:


Perfect! I can see all the legend tags that need to be updated. I'll focus on the actual view files (not the prompt files) and update each one to use "usa-legend--large" instead of "usa-legend". Let me start with the files in the app/views directory:


```ruby
        <legend class="usa-legend">Volunteer Shift Details</legend>

->

        <legend class="usa-legend--large">Volunteer Shift Details</legend>
```

```ruby
        <legend class="usa-legend">Check any of these that apply:</legend>

->

        <legend class="usa-legend--large">Check any of these that apply:</legend>
```

```ruby
        <legend class="usa-legend">Select all that apply:</legend>

->

        <legend class="usa-legend--large">Select all that apply:</legend>
```

```ruby
        <legend class="usa-legend">Paycheck Details</legend>

->

        <legend class="usa-legend--large">Paycheck Details</legend>
```

```ruby
        <legend class="usa-legend">Work Program Details</legend>

->

        <legend class="usa-legend--large">Work Program Details</legend>
```

```ruby
        <legend class="usa-legend">Student Details</legend>

->

        <legend class="usa-legend--large">Student Details</legend>
```

```ruby
        <legend class="usa-legend">Enrollment Status</legend>

->

        <legend class="usa-legend--large">Enrollment Status</legend>
```

```ruby
        <legend class="usa-legend">Basic Information</legend>

->

        <legend class="usa-legend--large">Basic Information</legend>
```

Perfect! I've successfully updated all the legend tags in the actual view files to use the "usa-legend--large" class. All the legend elements in the forms now have the larger styling as requested.

**User**

Why are there two legends on the students page? Can we combine them into one?

---

**Cursor**

Let me examine the students page to see the two legends and understand how we can combine them.


I can see the issue! There are indeed two legends on the students page:

1. "Student Details" (line 12) - the main fieldset legend
2. "Enrollment Status" (line 20) - a nested fieldset legend for the radio buttons

The "Enrollment Status" legend is nested inside the "Student Details" fieldset, which creates redundant labeling. We can combine them by removing the nested fieldset and just using the main "Student Details" legend. Let me update this:


```ruby
        <div class="usa-form-group">
          <fieldset class="usa-fieldset">
            <legend class="usa-legend--large">Enrollment Status</legend>
            <div class="usa-radio">
              <%= form.radio_button :enrollment_status, "half_time_or_more", class: "usa-radio__input", id: "enrollment_half_time_or_more" %>
              <%= form.label :enrollment_status_half_time_or_more, "Enrolled at least half-time", class: "usa-radio__label", for: "enrollment_half_time_or_more" %>
            </div>
            <div class="usa-radio">
              <%= form.radio_button :enrollment_status, "less_than_half_time", class: "usa-radio__input", id: "enrollment_less_than_half_time" %>
              <%= form.label :enrollment_status_less_than_half_time, "Enrolled less than half-time", class: "usa-radio__label", for: "enrollment_less_than_half_time" %>
            </div>
          </fieldset>
        </div>

->

        <div class="usa-form-group">
          <label class="usa-label">Enrollment Status</label>
          <div class="usa-radio">
            <%= form.radio_button :enrollment_status, "half_time_or_more", class: "usa-radio__input", id: "enrollment_half_time_or_more" %>
            <%= form.label :enrollment_status_half_time_or_more, "Enrolled at least half-time", class: "usa-radio__label", for: "enrollment_half_time_or_more" %>
          </div>
          <div class="usa-radio">
            <%= form.radio_button :enrollment_status, "less_than_half_time", class: "usa-radio__input", id: "enrollment_less_than_half_time" %>
            <%= form.label :enrollment_status_less_than_half_time, "Enrolled less than half-time", class: "usa-radio__label", for: "enrollment_less_than_half_time" %>
          </div>
        </div>
```

Perfect! I've combined the two legends into one by:

1. Removing the nested fieldset with the "Enrollment Status" legend
2. Converting it to a regular form group with a `usa-label` instead
3. Keeping the main "Student Details" legend as the primary fieldset legend

Now the form has a cleaner structure with just one legend ("Student Details") that encompasses all the form fields, while the enrollment status section uses a regular label instead of a nested legend. This eliminates the redundant labeling while maintaining clear organization and accessibility.

Remove all colons at the ends of field <label>s

---

**Cursor**

I'll search for all label elements that end with colons and remove them. Let me first find all the labels in the codebase.


Let me also search for form.label calls which might have colons:


Now I can see the labels that have colons. Let me focus on the actual view files (not the prompt files) and remove the colons from the labels. I'll start with the files that have colons:


```ruby
          <%= form.label :school_name, "School Name:", class: "usa-label" %>

->

          <%= form.label :school_name, "School Name", class: "usa-label" %>
```

```ruby
          <%= form.label :school_hours, "Number of hours you attend school per week:", class: "usa-label" %>

->

          <%= form.label :school_hours, "Number of hours you attend school per week", class: "usa-label" %>
```

```ruby
        <%= form.label :work_program_name, "Work Program Name:", class: "usa-label" %>

->

        <%= form.label :work_program_name, "Work Program Name", class: "usa-label" %>
```

```ruby
        <%= form.label :hours_attended, "Hours Attended:", class: "usa-label" %>

->

        <%= form.label :hours_attended, "Hours Attended", class: "usa-label" %>
```

Perfect! I've successfully removed all the colons from the field labels in the actual view files. The changes include:

1. **Students page**: Removed colons from "School Name:" and "Number of hours you attend school per week:"
2. **Work Programs page**: Removed colons from "Work Program Name:" and "Hours Attended:"

All the other labels in the view files (like "Full Name", "Email Address", "Organization Name", etc.) already didn't have colons, so they didn't need to be changed. The forms now have cleaner, more modern labeling without the trailing colons.

I can see from the terminal selection that you want me to move the validation errors outside of the form elements on the paychecks and volunteer shifts forms so they can expand to full width. Let me examine these forms and make the necessary changes.


I can see that both forms have validation error alerts inside the form element (lines 10-18 in both files). I'll move these error alerts outside the form so they can expand to full width. Let me update both files:


```ruby
    <%= form_with model: [@engagement_form, @job_paycheck], local: true, class: "usa-form" do |form| %>
      <% if @job_paycheck.errors.any? %>
        <div class="usa-alert usa-alert--error" role="alert">
          <div class="usa-alert__body">
            <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Please correct the following errors:</h4>
            <ul class="usa-alert__text">
              <% @job_paycheck.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
                <li><%= message %></li>
              <% end %>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      <% end %>

->

    <% if @job_paycheck.errors.any? %>
      <div class="usa-alert usa-alert--error" role="alert">
        <div class="usa-alert__body">
          <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Please correct the following errors:</h4>
          <ul class="usa-alert__text">
            <% @job_paycheck.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
              <li><%= message %></li>
            <% end %>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    <% end %>
    
    <%= form_with model: [@engagement_form, @job_paycheck], local: true, class: "usa-form" do |form| %>
```

```ruby
    <%= form_with model: [@engagement_form, @volunteer_shift], local: true, class: "usa-form" do |form| %>
      <% if @volunteer_shift.errors.any? %>
        <div class="usa-alert usa-alert--error" role="alert">
          <div class="usa-alert__body">
            <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Please correct the following errors:</h4>
            <ul class="usa-alert__text">
              <% @volunteer_shift.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
                <li><%= message %></li>
              <% end %>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      <% end %>

->

    <% if @volunteer_shift.errors.any? %>
      <div class="usa-alert usa-alert--error" role="alert">
        <div class="usa-alert__body">
          <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Please correct the following errors:</h4>
          <ul class="usa-alert__text">
            <% @volunteer_shift.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
              <li><%= message %></li>
            <% end %>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    <% end %>
    
    <%= form_with model: [@engagement_form, @volunteer_shift], local: true, class: "usa-form" do |form| %>
```

Perfect! I've moved the validation error alerts outside of the form elements on both the paychecks and volunteer shifts forms. Now the error messages will be able to expand to the full width of the container instead of being constrained by the form's width. The error alerts will appear above the form and span the entire width of the grid column, making them more prominent and easier to read.

I'll add the validation requirements to the students page. Let me first examine the current student model and controller to understand the structure, then add the appropriate validations.


Now let me check the EngagementForm model to see if there are any existing validations and understand the structure:


Now I need to add conditional validations to the EngagementForm model that only apply when the students page is being saved. I'll add a custom validation method and update the controller to handle validation errors properly.


```ruby
class EngagementForm < ApplicationRecord
  validates :user_name, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
  validates :application_date, presence: true
  
  has_many :volunteer_shifts, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :job_paychecks, dependent: :destroy

->

class EngagementForm < ApplicationRecord
  validates :user_name, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
  validates :application_date, presence: true
  
  # Student-specific validations
  validate :student_validations, if: :validating_student?
  
  has_many :volunteer_shifts, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :job_paychecks, dependent: :destroy
  
  attr_accessor :validating_student
```

Now I need to add the student validation method:


```ruby
  def prior_month_name
    return nil unless prior_month
    prior_month.strftime("%B %Y")
  end
end

->

  def prior_month_name
    return nil unless prior_month
    prior_month.strftime("%B %Y")
  end
  
  private
  
  def validating_student?
    validating_student == true
  end
  
  def student_validations
    # Require school_name
    errors.add(:school_name, "is required") if school_name.blank?
    
    # Require enrollment status
    errors.add(:enrollment_status, "is required") if enrollment_status.blank?
    
    # If enrollment status is less than half time, require the number of hours attended
    if enrollment_status == "less_than_half_time" && school_hours.blank?
      errors.add(:school_hours, "is required when enrolled less than half-time")
    end
  end
end
```

Now I need to update the students controller to set the validating_student flag and handle validation errors:


```ruby
  def create
    @engagement_form = EngagementForm.find(params[:engagement_form_id])
    
    # Handle both nested and direct parameters
    school_name = params[:engagement_form]&.dig(:school_name) || params[:school_name]
    enrollment_status = params[:engagement_form]&.dig(:enrollment_status) || params[:enrollment_status]
    school_hours = params[:engagement_form]&.dig(:school_hours) || params[:school_hours]
    
    @engagement_form.update(
      school_name: school_name,
      enrollment_status: enrollment_status,
      school_hours: school_hours
    )
    
    # Use the new next_path method
    redirect_to next_path(@engagement_form)
  end

->

  def create
    @engagement_form = EngagementForm.find(params[:engagement_form_id])
    
    # Handle both nested and direct parameters
    school_name = params[:engagement_form]&.dig(:school_name) || params[:school_name]
    enrollment_status = params[:engagement_form]&.dig(:enrollment_status) || params[:enrollment_status]
    school_hours = params[:engagement_form]&.dig(:school_hours) || params[:school_hours]
    
    # Set the validating_student flag to trigger student-specific validations
    @engagement_form.validating_student = true
    
    if @engagement_form.update(
      school_name: school_name,
      enrollment_status: enrollment_status,
      school_hours: school_hours
    )
      # Use the new next_path method
      redirect_to next_path(@engagement_form)
    else
      # Re-render the form with validation errors
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
```

Now I need to add error display to the students form view. Let me update the students/new.html.erb file to show validation errors:


```ruby
    <%= form_with model: @engagement_form, url: engagement_form_students_path(@engagement_form), method: :post, local: true, class: "usa-form" do |form| %>

->

    <% if @engagement_form.errors.any? %>
      <div class="usa-alert usa-alert--error" role="alert">
        <div class="usa-alert__body">
          <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Please correct the following errors:</h4>
          <ul class="usa-alert__text">
            <% @engagement_form.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
              <li><%= message %></li>
            <% end %>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    <% end %>
    
    <%= form_with model: @engagement_form, url: engagement_form_students_path(@engagement_form), method: :post, local: true, class: "usa-form" do |form| %>
```

Perfect! I've successfully added the validation requirements to the students page:

1. **Added conditional validations** to the `EngagementForm` model that only apply when `validating_student` is true
2. **Required validations**:
   - `school_name` is required
   - `enrollment_status` is required  
   - `school_hours` is required when enrollment status is "less_than_half_time"
3. **Updated the controller** to set the `validating_student` flag and handle validation errors by re-rendering the form
4. **Added error display** to the students form view to show validation messages

The validations will only trigger when the students page is being saved, and users will see clear error messages if they don't fill in the required fields. The form will re-render with the validation errors displayed at the top, allowing users to correct their input and resubmit.

**User**

I don't like this `validating_student` flag. Rewrite it to use validation contexts instead, e.g. `@engagement_form.valid?(:students_page)`.

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right! Using validation contexts is a much cleaner approach. Let me rewrite this to use Rails' built-in validation contexts instead of the custom flag.


```ruby
  # Student-specific validations
  validate :student_validations, if: :validating_student?
  
  has_many :volunteer_shifts, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :job_paychecks, dependent: :destroy
  
  attr_accessor :validating_student

->

  # Student-specific validations
  validates :school_name, presence: true, on: :students_page
  validates :enrollment_status, presence: true, on: :students_page
  validate :school_hours_required_when_less_than_half_time, on: :students_page
  
  has_many :volunteer_shifts, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :job_paychecks, dependent: :destroy
```

```ruby
  private
  
  def validating_student?
    validating_student == true
  end
  
  def student_validations
    # Require school_name
    errors.add(:school_name, "is required") if school_name.blank?
    
    # Require enrollment status
    errors.add(:enrollment_status, "is required") if enrollment_status.blank?
    
    # If enrollment status is less than half time, require the number of hours attended
    if enrollment_status == "less_than_half_time" && school_hours.blank?
      errors.add(:school_hours, "is required when enrolled less than half-time")
    end
  end

->

  private
  
  def school_hours_required_when_less_than_half_time
    if enrollment_status == "less_than_half_time" && school_hours.blank?
      errors.add(:school_hours, "is required when enrolled less than half-time")
    end
  end
```

```ruby
    # Set the validating_student flag to trigger student-specific validations
    @engagement_form.validating_student = true
    
    if @engagement_form.update(
      school_name: school_name,
      enrollment_status: enrollment_status,
      school_hours: school_hours
    )

->

    if @engagement_form.update(
      school_name: school_name,
      enrollment_status: enrollment_status,
      school_hours: school_hours
    )
```

Now I need to update the controller to use the validation context when checking validity:


```ruby
    if @engagement_form.update(
      school_name: school_name,
      enrollment_status: enrollment_status,
      school_hours: school_hours
    )
      # Use the new next_path method
      redirect_to next_path(@engagement_form)
    else
      # Re-render the form with validation errors
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end

->

    # Update the attributes
    @engagement_form.assign_attributes(
      school_name: school_name,
      enrollment_status: enrollment_status,
      school_hours: school_hours
    )
    
    # Validate with the students_page context
    if @engagement_form.valid?(:students_page)
      @engagement_form.save!
      # Use the new next_path method
      redirect_to next_path(@engagement_form)
    else
      # Re-render the form with validation errors
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
```

Perfect! I've successfully rewritten the validation system to use Rails' built-in validation contexts instead of the custom flag. Here's what changed:

1. **Removed the custom `validating_student` flag** and `attr_accessor`
2. **Used Rails validation contexts** with `on: :students_page` for the student-specific validations:
   - `school_name` presence validation
   - `enrollment_status` presence validation  
   - Custom validation for `school_hours` when enrollment status is "less_than_half_time"
3. **Updated the controller** to use `@engagement_form.valid?(:students_page)` to check validity with the specific context
4. **Used `assign_attributes` and `save!`** pattern for better control over the validation and save process

This approach is much cleaner and follows Rails conventions. The validation context `:students_page` clearly indicates when these validations should apply, and the code is more maintainable without the custom flag.
