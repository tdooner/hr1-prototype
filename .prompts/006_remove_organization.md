Remove the "organizations" question from the first page (the EngagementFormsController) and the model. Drop the database column too.

I'll help you remove the "organizations" question from the first page and clean up the related code and database. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the current structure.


Now let me look at the view files to understand the current structure:


Now let me check the database schema to understand the current structure:


Now let me check if there are any existing migrations to understand the migration history:


Let me check the original migration that created the engagement_forms table:


Perfect! Now I understand the structure. I need to:

1. Remove the `organization` field from the form view
2. Remove the `organization` field from the controller's permitted parameters
3. Remove the `organization` validation from the model
4. Create a migration to drop the `organization` column from the database

Let me start by creating the migration to drop the organization column:


Good! The migration was generated correctly. Now let me update the form to remove the organization field:


```ruby
    <div class="usa-form-group">
      <%= form.label :email, "Email Address", class: "usa-label" %>
      <%= form.email_field :email, class: "usa-input", required: true %>
    </div>
    
    <div class="usa-form-group">
      <%= form.label :organization, "Organization", class: "usa-label" %>
      <%= form.text_field :organization, class: "usa-input", required: true %>
    </div>

->

    <div class="usa-form-group">
      <%= form.label :email, "Email Address", class: "usa-label" %>
      <%= form.email_field :email, class: "usa-input", required: true %>
    </div>
```

Now let me update the controller to remove the organization parameter:


```ruby
  def engagement_form_params
    params.require(:engagement_form).permit(:user_name, :email, :organization)
  end

->

  def engagement_form_params
    params.require(:engagement_form).permit(:user_name, :email)
  end
```

Now let me update the model to remove the organization validation:


```ruby
class EngagementForm < ApplicationRecord
  validates :user_name, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
  validates :organization, presence: true
  
  has_many :volunteer_shifts, dependent: :destroy
end

->

class EngagementForm < ApplicationRecord
  validates :user_name, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
  
  has_many :volunteer_shifts, dependent: :destroy
end
```

Now let me run the migration to drop the organization column:


Now let me check if there are any tests that need to be updated to remove references to the organization field:


I need to update the test files to remove references to the organization field. Let me start with the main engagement forms spec:


```ruby
  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com", organization: "Test Org") }

->

  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com") }
```

```ruby
      post "/engagement_forms", params: { engagement_form: { user_name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com", organization: "Test Org" } }

->

      post "/engagement_forms", params: { engagement_form: { user_name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" } }
```

```ruby
      expect(response.body).to include(engagement_form.organization)

->


```

```ruby
      patch "/engagement_forms/#{engagement_form.id}", params: { engagement_form: { user_name: "Updated Name", email: "updated@example.com", organization: "Updated Org" } }

->

      patch "/engagement_forms/#{engagement_form.id}", params: { engagement_form: { user_name: "Updated Name", email: "updated@example.com" } }
```

```ruby
        expect(engagement_form.organization).to eq("Updated Org")

->


```

```ruby
        patch "/engagement_forms/#{engagement_form.id}", params: { engagement_form: { user_name: "", email: "invalid-email", organization: "" } }

->

        patch "/engagement_forms/#{engagement_form.id}", params: { engagement_form: { user_name: "", email: "invalid-email" } }
```

Now let me update the other test files:


```ruby
  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com", organization: "Test Org") }

->

  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com") }
```

```ruby
  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com", organization: "Test Org") }

->

  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com") }
```

```ruby
  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com", organization: "Test Org") }

->

  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com") }
```

```ruby
  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com", organization: "Test Org") }

->

  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com") }
```

```ruby
  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com", organization: "Test Org") }

->

  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com") }
```

```ruby
  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com", organization: "Test Org") }

->

  let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com") }
```

```ruby
    let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com", organization: "Test Org") }

->

    let(:engagement_form) { EngagementForm.create!(user_name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com") }
```

Now let me update the factory files:


```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :engagement_form do
    user_name { "MyString" }
    email { "MyString" }
    organization { "MyString" }
  end
end

->

FactoryBot.define do
  factory :engagement_form do
    user_name { "MyString" }
    email { "MyString" }
  end
end
```

Now let me run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly:


Great! The tests are passing. Let me also run a quick test to make sure the application starts correctly:


The server is already running. Let me check if there are any other references to the organization field that I might have missed:


I can see that the remaining references to "organization" are mostly in:
1. The `volunteer_shifts` table which has `organization_name` (this is different and should stay)
2. Documentation files (Agents.md and .prompts files)
3. Some view files that might need updating

Let me check if there are any view files that still reference the organization field:


I need to remove the organization references from these view files. Let me update them:


```ruby
        <p><strong>Organization:</strong> <%= @engagement_form.organization %></p>

->


```

```ruby
        <p><strong>Organization:</strong> <%= @engagement_form.organization %></p>

->


```

```ruby
        <div class="field-value"><%= @engagement_form.organization %></div>

->


```

```ruby
        <p><strong>Organization:</strong> <%= @engagement_form.organization %></p>

->


```

I also need to remove the field labels for organization in the PDF view:


```ruby
    <div class="field">
      <span class="field-label">Organization:</span>
      
    </div>

->


```

Now let me run the tests again to make sure everything is still working:


Perfect! Now let me update the Agents.md file to reflect the changes:


```markdown
1. **Initial Form** (`/engagement_forms/new`) - Basic user info (name, email, organization)

->

1. **Initial Form** (`/engagement_forms/new`) - Basic user info (name, email)
```

```markdown
# Core fields
user_name: string
email: string  
organization: string

->

# Core fields
user_name: string
email: string
```

Perfect! I have successfully removed the "organizations" question from the first page and cleaned up all related code. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Changes Made:

1. **Database Migration**: Created and ran a migration to drop the `organization` column from the `engagement_forms` table
2. **Form View**: Removed the organization field from the form partial (`_form.html.erb`)
3. **Controller**: Updated the `EngagementFormsController` to remove `organization` from permitted parameters
4. **Model**: Removed the `organization` validation from the `EngagementForm` model
5. **View Files**: Removed organization references from all view files (summary pages, show pages, PDF template)
6. **Tests**: Updated all test files to remove organization field from test data and assertions
7. **Factory**: Updated the factory to remove the organization field
8. **Documentation**: Updated `Agents.md` to reflect the removal of the organization field

The application now only collects the user's name and email on the first page, and all tests are passing. The organization field has been completely removed from the codebase while preserving the `organization_name` field in the `volunteer_shifts` table, which is used for tracking individual volunteer shifts.
